Mxl3 - Michael Li

1. The code had too many front end classes, and not enough back-end classes. This lowers flexibility. There is however, a composition that allows for efficient communication.
2. The code has a lot of classes, with different functions. Most methods are private and allow for secret/hidden implementation of the features.
3. The code does not handle exceptions, which is something that should be implemented in the new feature.
4. Our code has a designated structure that tries to combine certain aspects of front-end and back-end necessary to implement the features quickly, and organize the objects in a pipeline hierarchy.




ZZ45 - Zhiyong Zhao

1. The code is designed to be fairly flexible. The structure is designed in such a way where new features are simple additions to a pinpoint class.
2.  The existing API methods within the classes are very well related to the classes  and the required features they belong to. There are some features missing, like missing function functionalities, but otherwise, the methods are well-suited.
3. Exceptions will be thrown in the consoles
		String parsing error (bad code) -detected in backend, and thrown in   console front-end.
		It can be argued that all errors and exceptions are string errors.
4. Most of the information is hidden from user through using lots of internal calculations in the back-end, and outputted in the front-end. By doing this, the information is hidden from the user.





Part 2
Answered together


1. The MVC could be a beneficial design pattern. By allowing only one pipeline for communication, it allows us keep a separation between front-end and back-end.
2. An Enumerated Type could be very useful for front-end design, and regular expressions are very useful for the back-end parsing, as well as bindings for front-end. Reflection could be used for string to class parsing and generics could possibly be used for the program, but nothing specific right now. 
3. Zhiyong - The pen tracing part for drawing the turtle is interesting. Using math to solve the tracing is an interesting problem.
	Michael- I'm working on the parsing tree, which would be interesting to organize.
4. Zhiyong - Storing functions could potentially be problematic.
	Michael- While the parsing tree is going to be interesting, working on it and actually implementing it might be troublesome.
