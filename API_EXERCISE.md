1. Parsing should take place in the backend. We will have a play button the user can press as soon as they want their code to run. As soon as this button is pressed,
the commands they entered are sent to the backend.
2. The result of parsing is a list of commands that are sent to the actual engine in the backend. The parser would determing what commands are put in the list.
3. Errors are detected in the parsing step in the backend. When an input from the commandline is invalid an exception interface will pop up and explain why
the commandline is invalid.
4. Commands know the input given and they "get" this information when the engine determines the input from the parsed string.
5. The GUI tells the backengine to execute commands step-by-step and the new position and other relevant information is passed from the backend to the
frontend and the GUI executes the animation.
